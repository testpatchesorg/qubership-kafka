# Overview

The dashboards provide the following parameters to configure at the top of the dashboard:

* Interval time for metric display
* Node name

For all graph panels, the mean metric value is used in the given interval. For all `singlestat` panels, the last metric value is used.

# Kafka Monitoring

This section describes the Kafka Monitoring dashboard and its metrics.

## Dashboard

Some widgets on the **Cluster Overview** panel are different for InfluxDB and Prometheus.
Prometheus dashboard shows information about ready pods, but InfluxDB dashboard does not contain information about ready pods.

An overview of Kafka Monitoring dashboard for Prometheus is shown below.

![Prometheus Dashboard](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_dashboard-prometheus.png)

An overview of Kafka Monitoring dashboard for InfluxDB is shown below.

![InfluxDB Dashboard](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_dashboard-influxdb.png)

### Metrics

**Cluster Overview**

Prometheus panel:

![Cluster Overview Prometheus](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_cluster_overview-prometheus.png)

InfluxDB panel:

![Cluster Overview InfluxDB](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_cluster_overview-influxdb.png)

* `Cluster status` - Displays the status of Kafka cluster.
* `Current cluster size` - Displays the current size of Kafka cluster.
* `Ready Pods` - Displays the count of the ready pods.

   **Note**: This widget is displayed only for the Prometheus dashboard. Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).

* `Current controller broker id` - Displays the broker ID of the current controller. The first node to boot in 
  a Kafka cluster automatically becomes the controller, and there can be only one. The controller 
  in a Kafka cluster is responsible for maintaining the list of partition leaders and coordinating 
  leadership transitions (in the event a partition leader becomes unavailable). If it becomes 
  necessary to replace the controller, a new controller is randomly chosen by ZooKeeper from the pool 
  of brokers. In general, it is not possible for this value to be greater than one, but you should 
  definitely get an alert on a value of zero.
* `Controller State` - Displays the state of the controller broker. The controller changes state when processing an event. 
  Most of the time, the `Idle` state is displayed, which depicts that the controller has processed all the events. 
  If the event processing takes a considerable amount of time, several seconds or more, the state matching the processing event is
  displayed.
  The controller can have one of the following states:
  * Idle
  * ControllerChange
  * BrokerChange
  * TopicChange
  * TopicDeletion
  * AlterPartitionReassignment
  * AutoLeaderBalance
  * ManualLeaderBalance
  * ControlledShutdown
  * IsrChange
  * LeaderAndIsrResponseReceived
  * LogDirChange
  * ControllerShutdown
  * UncleanLeaderElectionEnable
  * TopicUncleanLeaderElectionEnable
  * ListPartitionReassignment
  * UpdateMetadataResponseReceived
  * KRaft
* `Kafka version` - Displays the Kafka version running on the controller broker.
* `Similar Configs` - Displays the information about brokers configuration consistency. It displays `Yes` if the configuration
  is same across all brokers. Otherwise, it displays
  `No: [{name of any discrepant config}: {value on one broker} VS {different value on another broker}]`.
* `Pods Readiness Probe` - Displays the readiness probe state for each Kafka pod.

  **Note**: This widget is displayed only for Prometheus dashboard. Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).

* `Broker Metrics` - Displays the information about brokers as a table:
   * Broker ID - The ID of the broker.
   * Broker State - The broker can have one of the following states:
     * NotRunning
     * Starting
     * RecoveringFromUncleanShutdown
     * RunningAsBroker
     * PendingControlledShutdown
     * BrokerShuttingDown
   * Partitions - The number of partition replicas on the broker.
   * Broker Skew - The deviation in percent of the average number of partitions per broker. It can be negative if the partitions number
     on the broker is less than the average.
   * Partition Leadership - The number of partitions where the broker is a leader.
   * Broker Leader Skew - The deviation in percent of the average number of partition leadership per broker. 
     It can be negative if the broker is a leader for fewer number of partitions than the average.
   * Under Replicated Partitions - The number of under-replicated partitions (|ISR| < |current replicas|).
   * Under Min ISR Partitions - The number of partitions whose in-sync replicas count is less than Minimum In-sync Replicas.

**Broker Issues**

![Broker Issues](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_broker_issues.png)

* `Under Replicated Partitions` - The number of under-replicated partitions. Replicas that are added as part of
   a reassignment will not count toward this value.
* `Under Min ISR Partitions` - The number of partitions whose in-sync replicas (ISR) count is less than `minIsr`.
* `Offline Partitions` - The number of partitions that don’t have an active leader and are hence not writable or readable.
* `Partitions With Late Transactions` - The number of partitions which have open transactions with durations exceeding
  `transaction.max.timeout.ms` (plus 5 minutes).
* `Broker Errors Rate` - The rate of errors in responses counted per error code. If a response contains multiple errors, all are counted.

**Topics**

![Topics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_topics.png)

* `Total Topics Count` - Displays the total count of topics on Kafka cluster.
* `Total Partitions Count` - Displays the total count of partitions on Kafka cluster.
* `Max Partitions Per Broker` - Displays the number of max partitions per broker. May be not applicable for managed external Kafka.
* `Topics Without Leader` - Displays the count of topics which have at least one partition without a leader (offline partitions).
* `Offline partitions count` - Displays the number of partitions without an active leader. All read and 
  write operations are only performed on partition leaders, a non-zero value for this metric 
  should be alerted to prevent service interruptions. Any partition without an active leader 
  is completely inaccessible, and both consumers and producers of that partition are blocked 
  until a leader becomes available.
  Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).
* `Under Replicated Topics` - Displays the count of topics which have at least one under-replicated partition.
  Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).
* `Topics With Unclean Leader Election Enabled` - Displays the count of topics with unclean leader election enabled. 
  Unclean leader elections can lead to data loss, so you should check these topics to see if this setting is set reasonably.
  Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).

**Consumer Groups Metrics**

![Consumer Groups Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_consumer_groups_metrics.png)

* `Consumer Groups Number` - Displays the number of consumer groups in different states as a table.

**JVM Heap and GC Metrics**

![JVM Heap and GC Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_jvm_heap_and_gc_metrics.png)

* `JVM Heap Usage` - Displays the JVM heap usage by broker.
* `JVM Heap Usage in Percent` - Displays the JVM heap usage by broker in percent (%).
* `GC Time` - Displays the garbage collection time rate per second by broker.
* `GC Count` - Displays the garbage collection count rate per second by broker.

NOTE: JVM metrics are not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).

**RAM Memory Metrics**

![RAM Memory Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_ram_memory_metrics.png)

* `Memory usage` - Displays the memory usage by pod. Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK).

**CPU**

![CPU](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_cpu.png)

* `Disk Write Bytes` - Displays the total size in bytes of write operations on the volume for each broker.
* `Topic Partition Data Size` - Displays the total size in bytes of volume space occupied by topic partitions logs for each broker.

**Controller Queues Metrics**

![Controller Queues Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_controller_queues_metrics.png)

* `Total Queue Size` - Displays the total number of controller requests to be sent out to brokers by `ControllerChannelManager`. 
  `ControllerChannelManager` establishes connection to every broker and starts a corresponding `RequestSendThread` 
  to keep sending queued controller requests.
* `Event Queue Size` - Displays the size of the `ControllerEventManager`'s queue. 
  Every `ControllerEvent` has an associated state. When a `ControllerEvent` is processed, it triggers a state transition 
  to the requested state. The `ControllerEvent` events are managed by `ControllerEventManager`.

  **Note**: Normally values of `Total Queue Size` and `Event Queue Size` metrics should be small or zero, 
  because requests and events are sent quickly within milliseconds, and they do not stay in the queue for a long time. 
  The increase in the value of these metrics depicts that the Kafka controller and the whole cluster is under a heavy load.

* `Event Queue Time Rate` - Displays the time it takes for any event, except the `Idle` event, to wait 
  in the `ControllerEventManager`'s queue before being processed.

**Network Metrics**

![Network Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_network_metrics.png)

* `Bytes In/Out` - Displays the aggregate incoming/outgoing byte rate per second.
* `Bytes Rejected` - Displays the amount of data in bytes per second rejected by broker.

**ZooKeeper Connection Metrics**

![ZooKeeper Connection Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_zookeeper_connection_metrics.png)

* `ZooKeeper Session State` - Displays ZooKeeper session state for each broker as a table.
  Not applicable for external managed Kafka (e.g. Amazon MSK). The possible states are:
  * CONNECTING
  * ASSOCIATING
  * CONNECTED
  * CONNECTEDREADONLY
  * CLOSED
  * AUTH_FAILED
  * NOT_CONNECTED
* `ZooKeeper Requests Rate` - Rate of ZooKeeper requests. May be not applicable for managed external Kafka.
* `ZooKeeper Requests Latency` - Latency of ZooKeeper requests. May be not applicable for managed external Kafka.

**In Sync Replica (ISR) Metrics**

![ISR Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_isr_metrics.png)

* `Isr Expands Rate` - Displays if a broker goes down, then the ISR for some partitions shrink.
  When that broker is up again, ISR is expanded after the replicas are fully caught up. 
  Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink and expansion rates is 0.
* `Isr Shrinks Rate` - Displays if a broker goes down, then ISR for some partitions shrink.
  When that broker is up again, ISR is expanded after the replicas are fully caught up. 
  Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink and expansion rates is 0.

**Messages Metric**

![Messages Metric](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_messages_metric.png)

* `Message Rate` - Displays the aggregate incoming messages rate per second.

**Request Metrics**

![Request Metrics](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_request_metrics.png)

* `Total Fetch Requests Rate` - Displays the total fetch request rate per second.
* `Total Produce Requests Rate` - Displays the total produce request rate per second.
* `Failed Fetch Requests Rate` - Displays the fetch request rate per second for requests that failed.
* `Failed Produce Requests Rate` - Displays the produce request rate per second for requests that failed.
* `Fetch Queue Size` - Displays the size of the fetch queue.
* `Request Queue Size` - Displays the size of the request queue. A congested request queue is not able to 
  process incoming or outgoing requests.

**Threads**

![Threads](/docs/public/images/kafka-monitoring_threads.png)

* `Thread count` - Displays the current number of live threads, including both daemon and non-daemon threads.
* `Total Started Thread Count` - Displays the total number of threads created and also started since the JVM started.
* `Log Cleaner And Replica Fetcher Threads` - Displays the information about configured and dead Log Cleaner and Replica Fetcher
  threads as a table.

**NOTE:** Kafka Monitoring dashboard has a link to `Node Details` dashboard which can be used for monitoring resources (CPU/Disk)
of external managed Kafka brokers (e.g. [Amazon MSK](managed/amazon.md#preparations-for-monitoring)).
Pay attention, this dashboard does not work with platform Kafka, and it could have a lot of empty panels for external Kafka.
